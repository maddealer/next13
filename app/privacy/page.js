            cookies. They may be placed on your device by someone who provides a
            service for us, for example to help us understand how our service is

            The length of time a cookie will remain on your computer or mobile
            device depends on whether it is a persistent or session cookie.
            Persistent cookies are stored as a file on your computer or mobile
            device for a long period of time until your browser deletes them or
            they lose their validity. Session cookies are temporarily placed on
            your computer when you visit our site, but are automatically deleted
            when you close the page.

            Most browsers allow you to view, manage, delete and block cookies
            for a website. Note that if you delete all cookies, all preferences
            you have set will be deleted, including the ability to opt out of
            cookies, as the feature itself requires an opt-out cookie to be
            placed on your device. Most browsers provide help pages related to
            cookie management. The links below will help you find the settings
            for some commonly used browsers: Google Chrome Internet Explorer
            Mozilla Firefox Safari (Desktop) Safari (Mobile) Android Browser
            Opera Opera Mobile For other browsers or additional information on
            cookie management, please read the documentation provided by your
            browser manufacturer or visit: www.aboutcookies.org or
            www.cookiecentral.com/faq/. Additionally, on your iPhone, iPad, or
            Android, you can change your device settings to control whether you
            see online ads based on your interests. Please note that if you
            restrict the ability of websites and applications to use cookies,
            you may degrade your overall user experience and/or lose the ability
            to access the Services because it will no longer be personalized for
            you. It may also prevent you from saving custom settings, such as
            your login information.
